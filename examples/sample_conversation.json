    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs are a set of rules and conventions for building web services. They use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources identified by URLs. REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request contains all the information needed to process it."

  },
  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Key differences include: 1) REST uses multiple endpoints for different resources, while GraphQL uses a single endpoint. 2) REST can lead to over-fetching or under-fetching data, while GraphQL lets clients request exactly what they need. 3) REST is simpler and more mature, while GraphQL offers more flexibility but with added complexity. 4) REST uses HTTP status codes for responses, while GraphQL typically returns 200 OK with error details in the response body."

  {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Choose REST if: you want simplicity, have straightforward CRUD operations, need good caching, or are building a simple API. Choose GraphQL if: you need flexible data fetching, have complex data relationships, want to reduce network requests, or are building a data-heavy application with diverse client needs. For most projects, especially when starting out, REST is often the better choice due to its simplicity and widespread support."
