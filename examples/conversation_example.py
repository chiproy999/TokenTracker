Unlike classical computers that use bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use quantum bits or 'qubits' that can exist in multiple states simultaneously through a property called superposition."},

        {"role": "assistant", "content": "The key differences are: 1) Qubits can be in superposition (multiple states at once), 2) Quantum entanglement allows qubits to be correlated in ways classical bits cannot, 3) This enables quantum computers to explore many possible solutions simultaneously, potentially solving certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers."},

However, we're still in the early stages - most quantum computers today are experimental and limited in scope."}
